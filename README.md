# useEffect Cleanup Function Not Called on Unmount in React 19

This repository demonstrates a bug where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook is not being called when the component unmounts. This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

The provided code shows a simple component with a `useEffect` hook.  The cleanup function within `useEffect` is intended to be executed when the component unmounts. However, under certain circumstances (potentially related to React 19 specific optimizations or edge cases), this cleanup function may not be called consistently, resulting in resources not being released as expected. 

## Solution

The solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the cleanup function is reliably called on unmount.  This can be achieved by using techniques to manage async operations more robustly and prevent scenarios where React might prematurely stop the component before the cleanup function has a chance to run. This generally involves using techniques like React's `useRef` or manually tracking the lifecycle and timing of asynchronous calls.
